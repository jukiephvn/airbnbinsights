            One reason that Airbnb has a significant impact on the housing availability is due to increased tourism.
            With our study being based in the area of Los Angeles, the effect of tourism on Airbnb usage has a major
            influence on tourist influxes in places such as Hollywood and Santa Monica. With more technology being
            introduced into society, traveling becomes much easier for the average person, allowing a constant rise in
            tourism around the world. The main issue is the supply and demand shift which comes with the inevitable rise
            in tourists. With the constant growth in tourism, the demand is short-term rentals, in this case, Airbnbs,
            will rise. This, in turn, will increase the economy, causing the prices of these rentals to increase in
            value.


            <br /><br />


            Many property owners interested in Airbnb ownership have acknowledged the demand for
            short-term rentals and have decided to capitalize on it. Due to the major cash flow created from tourism,
            Airbnb owners want to opt for short-term rentals over traditional long-term rentals because of better profit
            capability.


            <br /><br />


            Similarly, according to Wyman’s study in 2022, short-term rental properties will tend
            to sell at a premium compared to long-term rentals; this incentivizes homeowners to engage in listing
            short-term rentals (Wyman, 2022). 


            <br /><br />

            Not only will Airbnb owners look into creating short-term
            rentals, but homeowners may try to get into the business as an easy way to make extra cash. The success of
            short-term rentals can be seen in the visualization below created from the Inside Airbnb dataset, showing
            the top Airbnb owners in Los Angeles and their average minimum nights required to rent:

          According to the website containing the dataset, a short term rental is a property with less than 30 minimum
          nights required to stay (“Inside Airbnb”, 2022). To no surprise, the majority of the top owners do not require
          a large amount of minimum nights to stay at the rental, resulting in them being the most successful in the
          business. In turn, long-term rental/housing is in less of a demand, due to these properties being turned into
          short-term rental units.

          <br /><br />


          The constant increase in tourism also influences Airbnb owners to acquire
          more property in the area to meet the needs of these rental spaces. By getting into this cycle, it is easy to
          earn a bigger profit by reinvesting the money from current short-term rentals into more properties to use for
          short-term rentals. Owners will easily start building up multiple property ownership due to this income
          strategy. Using the dataset from Inside Airbnb, the visualization below shows this pattern of top hosts and
          the amount of properties they own:

          With companies such as Blueground, owning hundreds of Airbnb locations in just the Los Angeles area, plenty of
          these locations are used strictly for short-term rental. Even individuals are capitalizing on this; Shelly, a
          single host entity who is not affiliated with a company, owns over two hundred properties alone. With many
          people buying vast amounts of properties for their business, the housing availability is bound to shift. Horn
          investigates this in her article about the impact of Airbnb density in Boston, where an increase in Airbnb
          listings will increase rent price askings close by (Horn, 2017). The fact that most of these top Airbnb owners
          will invest money into more properties will cause a significant increase in housing/rental prices in the area.
          Large-scale acquisitions are a big part of successful Airbnb businesses, causing a big shift in available
          properties due to so many becoming unavailable to others.

          The top five listings in Hollywood, Beverly Hills, Downtown, Santa Monica, and Beverly Grove stand out for
          containing more expensive average price listings. This concentration reinforces existing wealth disparities
          within the city, emphasizing property ownership among wealthier individuals in expensive, high-traffic areas.
          These property owners are positioned to invest in prime real estate, contributing to the broader trend of
          affluent communities being controlled by a select group of individuals. If the number of high-value listings
          sees an increase in upscale areas, then the affordability and availability of housing becomes a significant
          challenge for renters in less affluent neighborhoods, eventually pushing these residents out of those
          communities.

        <img class="line-2" src="img/line-44.svg" />
        <p class="as-we-have-shown">
          As we have shown already, a rising increase in Airbnb listings leads to a rising increase in home prices. This
          increase has led to a “rent gap” between landlords and renters, which has incentivized landlords to turn to
          more affluent newcomers while ignoring and displacing poorer residents (Wachsmuth, 2018). In such scenarios, a
          cycle unfolds that unfortunately tends to leave the more economically vulnerable members of the community at a
          disadvantage, while simultaneously contributing to the prosperity of the more affluent residents. This dynamic
          widens the wealth gap and leads to greater gentrification (Wachsmuth, 2018).

          <br /><br />

          Airbnb has also proven itself to be a major financial incentive for professional landlords. From 2014-2015, the Los Angeles
          Alliance for a New Economy (LAANE) found that the presence of leasing companies on the platform jumped from
          6-9% and that 37% of all revenue from the site was from these companies (Wachsmuth, 2018). In contrast, the
          amount of hosts renting a single room (which tend to be individuals instead of companies) has dropped from 56%
          to 37% (Wachsmuth, 2018). Airbnb has also been shown to disproportionately skew its gains to those with more
          wealth (Li, 2019). This unequal distribution of profits, combined with the increase in housing purchases being
          made by leasing companies, has made it increasingly harder for lower income residents to enter the real estate
          market, which has led to greater gentrification in residential neighborhoods with a greater Airbnb presence.
          As such, the concentration of property ownership among wealthier entities has skyrocketed in these
          neighborhoods (Li, 2019).

        <p class="text-wrapper-12">
          The challenges associated with Airbnb have become increasingly pronounced, signaling a call for action from
          policymakers. However, there are a lot of problems surrounding the creation and enforcement of policy
          regarding short-term rentals. Firstly, lawmakers have found it challenging to differentiate between
          residential units used as permanent residences for long-term homeowners and renters, and as hotel-like
          accommodations for short-term guests (Wegmann, 2017). Lawmakers are also having a hard time enforcing policies
          that they create as most cities can’t seem to find the right balance of enforcement that is necessary
          (Nieuwland, 2020).
        </p>
        <p class="los-angeles-already">
          Los Angeles already has a set of policies that lawmakers believe is sufficient. However, the current
          enforcement situation in Los Angeles is sub-optimal. The vast majority of listings in Los Angeles aren’t
          operated with a license, and around 20% of the ones that are operated with a license don’t comply with the
          policies that the license mandates (Nieuwland, 2020). This leads us to believe that although setting good
          policies is important, it’s more important to enforce policies. <br /><br />Various resolutions exist for
          these issues. For example, Denver has found a moderately successful way to enforce their policies on
          short-term rentals. A study on their enforcement system found that they have a compliance rate of around 50%.
          After Denver passed its major policy in 2016, the city decided to keep their licensing and enforcement
          entirely online. Instead of doing door-to-door inspections and listed properties, Denver officials police
          listers by requiring that they include their license number and everything they do to comply with the policies
          in the descriptions of the listings. This allows officials to enforce the policies by simply keeping track of
          the online descriptions of listings (Nieuwland, 2020). <br /><br />
          We believe that policies should strike a balance between addressing affordable housing issues and the economic
          growth that can come from short-term rentals. For example, limiting(or completely banning) entire homes in
          residential neighborhoods as listings has proven to be an effective way of striking such a balance (Nieuwland,
          2020). This solution allows the city to protect affordable housing, while also allowing a growth in tourism in
          non-residential parts of the city. Another effective policy we would recommend would be limiting the number of
          days a property can be listed per year. This policy strikes a good balance as it forces properties to
          alternate between being short-term and long-term rentals.

            As Airbnb earned the title of being the largest online rental marketplace in the world (Airbnb, 2019), its
            achievement has marked the transformative era within hospitality services and housing accommodations. This
            dominance in the rental sphere is causing a decline in other online methods for searching for long-term
            rentals, such as Zillow, Apartments.com, and even Facebook Marketplace. Airbnb’s website infrastructure is
            simplistic enough that the community of hosts and guests can seamlessly search and list their desired
            properties. This eliminates the initial hurdles presented with searching and booking home rentals. In
            addition, consumers are attracted to the range of affordability Airbnb offers. Airbnb rental prices, on
            average, are 28% lower than average hotels within large cities in the U.S. (“Harvard Real Estate Review”,
            2019). Another appeal of Airbnb is that the options available also allow for intimate and alternate
            experiences with the option to share them with multiple people. The hotel industry lacks this ability to
            provide consumers with unique experiences and is limited in offering and expanding its strategies to appeal
            to people who need cheaper alternatives.<br /><br />Airbnb is becoming a more popularized service to assist
            in booking short and long-term rentals. As housing preferences are ever-changing, many factors are now
            aiding in the shift for short-term rentals to become more prevalent and customary. As mentioned above,
            short-term rentals became a new phenomenon as their demand was motivated by tourists seeking housing
            accommodations and residential property owners to operate under these tourists’ requests (Wyman, 2022).
            Guests who look for short-term rentals the majority of the time require a living area and cooking space,
            which hotels and motels lack. With the high demand for home utilities, this incentivizes hosts to convert
            their traditional listings to short-term rentals as it still affirms a more strict form of payment (Barron
            et al., 2021). Not only can these rentals be temporary and flexible to what a consumer is looking for at the
            time, but the trends within the housing market and regulations against short-term rentals are what aid in
            long-term rentals becoming more commonplace.

            residential areas due to increasing worry about the ever-increasing imbalance of tourists and residents
            (Matin, 2015). These implementations are then influencing other nearby neighborhoods, such as the home of
            Disneyland, Anaheim, California. Even with the city not being a part of Los Angeles County, this tourist hub
            is prevalent due to the impact policies can have on short-term rentals and how cities see them as a threat.
            Concentrated areas and tourist spots making the effort to adopt similar regulations to restrict these
            rentals which can better the survival of long-term rentals, although if not happening fast enough, Airbnb
            with its short-term rentals will continue to dominate (Martin, 2015).</span

        <p class="text-wrapper-15">
          The shift to short-term rentals within the housing market is causing an increase in property prices. A 1%
          increase in Airbnb listings leads to a 0.026% in housing prices (Wyman, 2022). This transformation heightens
          concerns about housing affordability in certain neighborhoods, especially hot-spots for tourism. Full-time
          short-term rentals have increased by 4 times the amount in 2010 within Los Angeles, causing an increase in
          rent prices where Airbnb was more popularized (Wyman, 2022).

            >Due to Airbnb’s impact on the housing market, property owners have recognized the influx in demand for
            short-term rentals and are taking advantage of the shift to utilizing Airbnb. This online platform became
            another way for owners to market their properties and guarantee high rental yields, twice or three times
            higher, especially in more populated cities with competitive markets (“Airbnb: A Game-Changer for the
            Commerical Property Market”, 2015). The main component driving the conversion of properties into short-term
            rentals is that they gain higher rental rates than long-term rentals. Not only that, the majority of these
            listings have kitchens and outdoor private lounge spaces, which then allow for these properties to be more
            desired and easily shift to short-term while maximizing the economic utility of the property. The rental can
            then benefit the property owner while residents can enjoy the upkeep of their neighborhood’s authenticity
            (</span

            new wave of hospitality services, landlords are now using this business in addition to their long-term
            rentals to market their properties (Li, 2019). Property owners are incentivized to keep their listings under
            Airbnb because even if there are no long-term tenants at the time it is posted, it is still beneficial to
            capitalize on short-term surges until higher or more frequent long-term rentals are needed (Barron et al.,
            2021).</span

        <p class="the-pie-graph">
          The pie graph portrays the amount of listings per room type in addition to the minimum number of nights per
          listing that fall in the same category. This graph was made using Tableau.<br /><br />It is important to note
          that Inside Airbnb does not provide data on the current state of Airbnb within Los Angeles, though, it is
          still highlighting very valuable information. In this chart, the hierarchy of room types is displayed in
          addition to the minimum nights. The leading category is entire home and private room categories are 30 minimum
          night listings. This graph supports how the majority of listings within Los Angeles do take advantage of the
          benefits and loopholes of being recognized as “long-term” rentals, as we will delve into later. <br /><br />Airbnb
          has issued a roadmap for their company, announcing the new goals they want to achieve by 2028. They have
          recognized that their platform has grown past their initial design to appeal to solo travelers and how
          families and groups of people are taking advantage of their services (Airbnb, 2019). The acceptance from the
          company realizing their initial goal has been shifted to appeal to different&nbsp;&nbsp;and larger communities
          further supports as to why entire homes with 30 minimum nights rank the highest in listing within the pie
          charts. They acknowledge that the market is geared towards rentals for certain occasions, like music
          festivals, weddings, and family travel. Airbnb’s method is the main option when it comes to finding group
          lodging for people needing to go to these events. 


          <br /><br />


          Although, Airbnb have not totally neglected
          their initial goal of appealing to solo travelers as private rooms are the second largest dominating room
          type.&nbsp;&nbsp;This goes to show that Airbnb as a company are fully adaptive to what is thrown at them and
          is expanding to meet the ever-increasing demands. As this company expands by offering new property types and
          investing more into the already loyal community, there is a definite expansion of the number of listings and
          room types available in the near future (Airbnb, 2019).

            >Presented in the visualization above, this bar graph displays the number of listings against the minimum
            number of nights needed for stay, ranging from 1 to 35+ nights. The short-term rental (STR) threshold marks
            the divide between what minimum nights are considered for a short-term rental while separating what
            long-term rentals are. According to California Senate Bill No. 60, Chapter 307, short-term rentals are
            anything listed with 29 consecutive nights and under. Anything 30 consecutive nights and above is considered
            a long-term rental (California Legislature, 2021). This graph was made using Tableau.<br /><br />With making
            listings above the STR threshold, there are certain regulations hosts can avoid (“Inside Airbnb”, 2022).
            This leads to hosts falling under the radar of policies or creating loopholes in regulations. This includes
            things such as the Strict long-term policy and firm long-term policy (</span
          >
          <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/475" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"

            >, 2023). These both extend the standard cancellation policy and limit the cancellation to happen 28 to 30
            days before check-in. Consequently, guests who cancel will pay for the nights spent in addition to 30
            additional nights. The Transient Occupancy Tax (TOT) is also another factor Airbnb hosts are aware of when
            it comes to hosting. TOT affects short-term rentals. In Los Angeles, the TOT rate is 14% (</span
          >
          <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/2297" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"

          <span class="text-wrapper-18"
            >, 2023). Hosts see how this additional cost is unappealing to guests and can be a headache for pricing
            strategy. Due to this, this is why there are so many hosts with listings as long-term rentals with 30+
            nights in order to avoid it all.</span

        <p class="legal-regulations">Legal Regulations and Avoidance from Landlords:</p>
        <p class="text-wrapper-20">
          Although it is enticing to property owners to gain an extra buck when listing under Airbnb, they have found
          ways to make use of the ambiguities within legal regulations. The process of converting a traditional
          long-term property into a listing on Airbnb is simple, as there are ways landlords can avoid any risk when
          making the switch in little to no time. The Ellis Act is a state law that permits property owners to evict
          tenants to “go out of business” (“Ellis Act Evictions”, 2023). Filing an Ellis Act with the Rent Board is
          usually utilized when landlords want to change the use of the property. Thus, the transformation of having
          rent-controlled tenants residing in traditional long-term leases to short-term Airbnb guests is more
          beneficial from a landlord’s perspective. This then threatens traditional long-term tenants as more property
          owners use the Ellis Act to hasten the process of financial gain as the surge for short-term rentals
          increases. Traditional tenants usually benefit from their rights and protections, but with the uncertainty of
          landlords utilizing this legal loophole, there are fewer legal safeguards for them.
