            The concept for Airbnb emerged when the founders, struggling to afford rent in San Francisco, decided to
            rent out air mattresses in their apartment during a design conference when hotels were fully booked. They
            provided breakfast for their guests, hence the original name &#34;AirBed &amp; Breakfast.”

            In 2008, during the SXSW (South by Southwest) conference held in Austin, the AirBed &amp; Breakfast platform
            made its debut, securing two bookings, one of which was made by Brian Chesky, one of the co-founders.<br /><br />Airbnb,
            then known as AirBed &amp; Breakfast, gained acceptance into the Y Combinator program, a prestigious Silicon
            Valley startup accelerator. This program provided valuable mentorship, resources, and guidance, contributing
            significantly to Airbnb&#39;s growth and development as a successful business venture.

              studio called Samara. Under this initiative, a prototype for a future house was introduced in Japan,
              marking a pioneering step towards innovative accommodation concepts within the company.<br /><br />Additionally,
              Airbnb made a momentous announcement by expanding its services beyond traditional home rentals with the
              launch of Trips. This expansion aimed to offer travelers unique experiences and activities alongside
              accommodations. The company celebrated this milestone by hosting the Airbnb Open event in Los Angeles,
              which welcomed approximately 7,000 attendees from over 100 countries, highlighting the global reach and
              impact of the platform.</span

          In just three weeks leading up to the first Rio World Cup, Airbnb succeeded in hosting more than 100,000
          guests, uniting them within the community. This event generated an estimated sum of approximately $30 million
          in earnings for hosts, marking a significant milestone for Airbnb during a major global gathering.<br /><br />Additionally,
          during this period, Airbnb introduced the Business Travel feature, simplifying the process of booking
          work-related trips through their platform. This development aimed to cater specifically to the needs of
          business travelers, offering them more convenient and suitable accommodations.

          landscapes, focusing on opening doors rather than building walls.
