            Understanding the depth and limitations of our dataset is crucial for a comprehensive analysis. Just like
            any dataset, ours carries inherent power, limitations, and a narrative that shape the insights it offers us.
            It&#39;s imperative to acknowledge where biases might reside and what aspects may remain unexplored. To
            navigate these aspects, we&#39;ve critically questioned the dataset&#39;s generation, its inherent
            exclusions, the scope of its information, and its original sources.

            Despite its breadth, the dataset does have limitations. Sensitive and private information such as personal
            contact details, non-public listings, or concealed host profiles aren&#39;t included due to privacy
            constraints imposed by Airbnb. Moreover, it lacks guest demographic data, insights into private host-guest
            communications, host motivations, and long-term effects on neighborhoods and housing markets. This absence
            restricts a comprehensive understanding of guest preferences, interactions, and the broader implications of
            Airbnb.

        <p class="the-dataset-s">
          The dataset&#39;s ontology, focusing on listings, hosts, and reviews, inherently influences the questions that
          can be posed and introduces certain biases. While it sheds light on critical aspects such as housing market
          impacts and guest experiences, it falls short in capturing nuanced social and economic implications
          comprehensively. Private interactions and their implications remain unexplored within this dataset, limiting a
          holistic view of Airbnb&#39;s effects.<br /><br />Recognizing these limitations, we advocate for a more
          holistic approach. Combining this dataset with other sources and conducting further research will pave the way
          for a more comprehensive understanding of Airbnb&#39;s multifaceted impacts on communities.
